  .B qmail-smtpd
  will wait for each new buffer of data from the remote SMTP client.
  Default: 1200.
+ .TP 5
+ .I spfbehavior
+ Set to a value between 1 and 6 to enable SPF checks; 0 to disable.
+ 1 selects 'annotate-only' mode, where
+ .B qmail-smtpd
+ will annotate incoming email with
+ .B Received-SPF
+ fields, but will not reject any messages.  2 will produce temporary
+ failures on DNS lookup problems so you can make sure you always have
+ meaningful Received-SPF headers.  3 selects 'reject' mode,
+ where incoming mail will be rejected if the SPF record says 'fail'.  4
+ selects a more stricter rejection mode, which is like 'reject' mode,
+ except that incoming mail will also be rejected when the SPF record
+ says 'softfail'.  5 will also reject when the SPF record says 'neutral',
+ and 6 if no SPF records are available at all (or a syntax error was
+ encountered). The contents of this file are overridden by the value of
+ the
+ .B SPFBEHAVIOR
+ environment variable, if set.
+ Default: 0.
+ .TP 5
+ .I spfexp
+ You can add a line with a an SPF explanation that will be shown to the
+ sender in case of a reject. It will override the default one. You can
+ use SPF macro expansion.
+ .TP 5
+ .I spfguess
+ You can add a line with SPF rules that will be checked if a sender
+ domain doesn't have a SPF record. The local rules will also be used
+ in this case.
+ .TP 5
+ .I spfrules
+ You can add a line with SPF rules that will be checked before other SPF
+ rules would fail.  This can be used to always allow certain machines to
+ send certain mails.
