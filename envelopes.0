       envelopes - sender/recipient lists attached to messages

       Electronic mail messages are delivered in _e_n_v_e_l_o_p_e_s.

       An  envelope  lists a _s_e_n_d_e_r and one or more _r_e_c_i_p_i_e_n_t_s.  Usually these
       envelope addresses are the same as the addresses listed in the  message
       header:

          (envelope) from djb to root
          From: djb
          To: root

       In  more  complicated  situations,  though,  the envelope addresses may
       differ from the header addresses.

       When a message is delivered to several people at  different  locations,
       it is first photocopied and placed into several envelopes:

          (envelope) from djb to root
          From: djb                          Copy #1 of message
          To: root, god@brl.mil

          (envelope) from djb to god@brl.mil
          From: djb                          Copy #2 of message
          To: root, god@brl.mil

       When a message is delivered to several people at the same location, the
       sender doesn't have to photocopy it.  He can instead stuff it into  one
       envelope   with   several  addresses;  the  recipients  will  make  the
       photocopy:

          (envelope) from djb to god@brl.mil, angel@brl.mil
          From: djb
          To: god@brl.mil, angel@brl.mil, joe, frde

       Bounced mail is sent back to the envelope sender address.  The  bounced
       mail doesn't list an envelope sender, so bounce loops are impossible:

          (envelope) from <> to djb
          From: MAILER-DAEMON
          To: djb
          Subject: unknown user frde

       The  recipient  of  a message may make another copy and forward it in a
       new envelope:

          (envelope) from djb to joe
          From: djb                          Original message
          To: joe

          (envelope) from joe to fred
          From: djb                          Forwarded message
          To: joe

       A mailing list works almost the same way:

          (envelope) from djb to sos-list
          From: djb                          Original message
          To: sos-list

          (envelope) from sos-owner to god@brl.mil
          From: djb                          Forwarded message
          To: sos-list                       to recipient #1

          (envelope) from sos-owner to frde
          From: djb                          Forwarded message
          To: sos-list                       to recipient #2

       Notice that the mailing list is set up to replace the  envelope  sender
       with something new, ssooss--oowwnneerr.  So bounces will come back to ssooss--oowwnneerr:

          (envelope) from <> to sos-owner
          From: MAILER-DAEMON
          To: sos-owner
          Subject: unknown user frde

       It's a good idea to set up an extra address, ssooss--oowwnneerr, like this:  the
       original  envelope  sender  (ddjjbb)  has  no  way  to  fix  bad  ssooss--lliisstt
       addresses, and of course bounces must not be sent to ssooss--lliisstt itself.

       Envelope sender and envelope recipient addresses  are  transmitted  and
       recorded in several ways.

       When  a user injects mail through qqmmaaiill--iinnjjeecctt, he can supply a RReettuurrnn--
       PPaatthh line or a --ff option  for  the  envelope  sender;  by  default  the
       envelope  sender  is  his login name.  The envelope recipient addresses
       can be taken from the command  line  or  from  various  header  fields,
       depending  on  the  options to qqmmaaiill--iinnjjeecctt.  Similar comments apply to
       sseennddmmaaiill.

       When a message is transferred from one machine to another through SMTP,
       the  envelope  sender  is  given  in  a MMAAIILL FFRROOMM command, the envelope
       recipients are given in RRCCPPTT TTOO commands, and the message  is  supplied
       separately by a DDAATTAA command.

       When  a  message  is  delivered  by  qqmmaaiill to a single local recipient,
       qqmmaaiill--llooccaall records the recipient  in  DDeelliivveerreedd--TToo  and  the  envelope
       sender  in RReettuurrnn--PPaatthh.  It uses DDeelliivveerreedd--TToo to detect mail forwarding
       loops.

       sseennddmmaaiill normally records the envelope sender in RReettuurrnn--PPaatthh.  It  does
       not  record  envelope  recipient addresses, on the theory that they are
       redundant: you received the mail, so you must  have  been  one  of  the
       envelope recipients.

       Note that, if the header doesn't have any recipient addresses, sseennddmmaaiill
       will move envelope recipient addresses  back  into  the  header.   This
       situation  occurs if all addresses were originally listed as BBcccc, since
       BBcccc is automatically removed.  When sseennddmmaaiill sees this,  it  creates  a
       new  AAppppaarreennttllyy--TToo  header field with the envelope recipient addresses.
       This has the strange effect that each blind-carbon-copy recipient  will
       see a list of all recipients on the same machine.

       When  a  message  is  stored  in  mmbbooxx  format,  the envelope sender is
       recorded at the top of the message as  a  UUCP-style  FFrroomm  (no  colon)
       line.   Note  that this line is less reliable than the RReettuurrnn--PPaatthh line
       added by qqmmaaiill--llooccaall or sseennddmmaaiill.
