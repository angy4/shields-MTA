       dot-qmail - control the delivery of mail messages

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       Normally the qqmmaaiill--llooccaall program delivers each incoming message to your
       system mailbox, _h_o_m_e_d_i_r//MMaaiillbbooxx, where _h_o_m_e_d_i_r is your home  directory.

       It can instead write the mail to a different file or directory, forward
       it to another address, distribute it to a mailing list, or even execute
       programs, all under your control.

TTHHEE QQMMAAIILL FFIILLEE
       To  change  qqmmaaiill--llooccaall's  behavior,  set up a ..qqmmaaiill file in your home
       directory.

       ..qqmmaaiill contains one or more lines.  Each line is  a  delivery  instruc-
       tion.   qqmmaaiill--llooccaall  follows  each instruction in turn.  There are five
       types of delivery instructions: (1) comment; (2) program; (3)  forward;
       (4) mbox; (5) maildir.

       (1)  A comment line begins with a number sign:

                 # this is a comment

            qqmmaaiill--llooccaall ignores the line.

       (2)  A program line begins with a vertical bar:

                 |preline /usr/ucb/vacation djb

            qqmmaaiill--llooccaall  takes  the rest of the line as a command to supply to
            sshh.  See qqmmaaiill--ccoommmmaanndd((88)) for further information.

       (3)  A forward line begins with an ampersand:

                 &me@new.job.com

            qqmmaaiill--llooccaall takes the rest of the line as a mail address; it  uses
            qqmmaaiill--qquueeuuee  to  forward the message to that address.  The address
            must contain a fully qualified domain name; it  must  not  contain
            extra spaces, angle brackets, or comments:

                 # the following examples are WRONG
                 &me@new
                 &<me@new.job.com>
                 & me@new.job.com
                 &me@new.job.com (New Address)

            If  the  address begins with a letter or number, you may leave out
            the ampersand:

                 me@new.job.com

            Note  that  qqmmaaiill--llooccaall  omits  its  new  RReettuurrnn--PPaatthh  line   when
            forwarding messages.

       (4)  An  _m_b_o_x  line begins with a slash or dot, and does not end with a
            slash:

                 /home/djb/Mailbox.sos

            qqmmaaiill--llooccaall takes the entire line as a filename.  It  appends  the
            mail  message  to  that  file,  using  fflloocckk-style file locking if
            possible.  qqmmaaiill--llooccaall stores the mail message in _m_b_o_x format,  as
            described in mmbbooxx((55)).

            WWAARRNNIINNGG:: On many systems, anyone who can read a file can fflloocckk it,
            and thus hold up qqmmaaiill--llooccaall's delivery forever.  Do  not  deliver
            mail to a publicly accessible file!

            If  qqmmaaiill--llooccaall  is able to lock the file, but has trouble writing
            to it (because, for example, the disk is full), it  will  truncate
            the  file back to its original length.  However, it cannot prevent
            mailbox corruption if the system crashes during delivery.

       (5)  A _m_a_i_l_d_i_r line begins with a slash or dot, and ends with a slash:

                 /home/djb/Maildir/

            qqmmaaiill--llooccaall takes the entire line as the name of  a  directory  in
            _m_a_i_l_d_i_r  format.   It reliably stores the incoming message in that
            directory.  See mmaaiillddiirr((55)) for more details.

       If ..qqmmaaiill has the execute bit set, it  must  not  contain  any  program
       lines,  _m_b_o_x  lines,  or  _m_a_i_l_d_i_r  lines.  If qqmmaaiill--llooccaall sees any such
       lines, it will stop and indicate a temporary failure.

       If ..qqmmaaiill is completely empty (0 bytes long), or does not exist, qqmmaaiill--
       llooccaall  follows  the  _d_e_f_a_u_l_t_d_e_l_i_v_e_r_y  instructions  set  by your system
       administrator; normally _d_e_f_a_u_l_t_d_e_l_i_v_e_r_y is  ..//MMaaiillbbooxx,  so  qqmmaaiill--llooccaall
       appends the mail message to MMaaiillbbooxx in _m_b_o_x format.

       ..qqmmaaiill  may  contain extra spaces and tabs at the end of a line.  Blank
       lines are allowed, but not for the first line of ..qqmmaaiill.

       If ..qqmmaaiill is world-writable or group-writable,  qqmmaaiill--llooccaall  stops  and
       indicates a temporary failure.

       Incoming messages can arrive at any moment.  If you want to safely edit
       your ..qqmmaaiill file, first set the sticky bit on your home directory:

            chmod +t $HOME

       qqmmaaiill--llooccaall will temporarily defer delivery of any message  to  you  if
       your  home  directory  is  sticky (or group-writable or other-writable,
       which should never happen).  Make sure to

            chmod -t $HOME

       when you are done!  It's a good idea to test your new  ..qqmmaaiill  file  as
       follows:

            qmail-local -n $USER ~ $USER '' '' '' '' ./Mailbox

EEXXTTEENNSSIIOONN AADDDDRREESSSSEESS
       In  the qqmmaaiill system, you control all local addresses of the form _u_s_e_r--
       _a_n_y_t_h_i_n_g, as well as the  address  _u_s_e_r  itself,  where  _u_s_e_r  is  your
       account  name.   Delivery  to  _u_s_e_r--_a_n_y_t_h_i_n_g  is controlled by the file
       _h_o_m_e_d_i_r_/..qqmmaaiill--_a_n_y_t_h_i_n_g.  (These rules may be  changed  by  the  system
       administrator; see qqmmaaiill--uusseerrss(5).)

       The  aalliiaass  user  controls  all  other addresses.  Delivery to _l_o_c_a_l is
       controlled by the file _h_o_m_e_d_i_r_/..qqmmaaiill--_l_o_c_a_l, where _h_o_m_e_d_i_r  is  aalliiaass's
       home directory.

       In  the  following  description,  qqmmaaiill--llooccaall  is  handling  a  message
       addressed to _l_o_c_a_l_@_d_o_m_a_i_n, where _l_o_c_a_l  is  controlled  by  ..qqmmaaiill--_e_x_t.
       Here is what it does.

       If   ..qqmmaaiill--_e_x_t   is   completely   empty,   qqmmaaiill--llooccaall   follows  the
       _d_e_f_a_u_l_t_d_e_l_i_v_e_r_y instructions set by your system administrator.

       If ..qqmmaaiill--_e_x_t doesn't exist, qqmmaaiill--llooccaall will try some  default  ..qqmmaaiill
       files.   For  example,  if  _e_x_t  is ffoooo--bbaarr, qqmmaaiill--llooccaall will try first
       ..qqmmaaiill--ffoooo--bbaarr, then ..qqmmaaiill--ffoooo--ddeeffaauulltt,  and  finally  ..qqmmaaiill--ddeeffaauulltt.
       If   none   of  these  exist,  qqmmaaiill--llooccaall  will  bounce  the  message.
       (Exception:  for  the  basic  _u_s_e_r  address,   qqmmaaiill--llooccaall   treats   a
       nonexistent ..qqmmaaiill the same as an empty ..qqmmaaiill.)

       WWAARRNNIINNGG:: For security, qqmmaaiill--llooccaall replaces any dots in _e_x_t with colons
       before checking ..qqmmaaiill--_e_x_t.  For convenience, qqmmaaiill--llooccaall converts  any
       uppercase letters in _e_x_t to lowercase.

       When  qqmmaaiill--llooccaall  forwards  a  message as instructed in ..qqmmaaiill--_e_x_t (or
       ..qqmmaaiill--ddeeffaauulltt), it checks whether ..qqmmaaiill--_e_x_t--oowwnneerr exists.  If so,  it
       uses  _l_o_c_a_l--oowwnneerr@@_d_o_m_a_i_n  as  the  envelope  sender  for  the forwarded
       message.  Otherwise it retains the  envelope  sender  of  the  original
       message.   Exception:  qqmmaaiill--llooccaall always retains the original envelope
       sender if it is the empty address or ##@@[[]], i.e., if this  is  a  bounce
       message.

       qqmmaaiill--llooccaall  also  supports  vvaarriiaabbllee eennvveellooppee rreettuurrnn ppaatthhss (VERPs): if
       ..qqmmaaiill--_e_x_t--oowwnneerr  and  ..qqmmaaiill--_e_x_t--oowwnneerr--ddeeffaauulltt  both  exist,  it  uses
       _l_o_c_a_l--oowwnneerr--@@_d_o_m_a_i_n--@@[[]]  as  the  envelope  sender.   This will cause a
       recipient   _r_e_c_i_p@@_r_e_c_i_p_h_o_s_t   to   see   an    envelope    sender    of
       _l_o_c_a_l--oowwnneerr--_r_e_c_i_p==_r_e_c_i_p_h_o_s_t@@_d_o_m_a_i_n.

       If  a  delivery  instruction  fails,  qqmmaaiill--llooccaall stops immediately and
       reports  failure.   qqmmaaiill--llooccaall  handles  forwarding  after  all  other
       instructions, so any error in another type of delivery will prevent all
       forwarding.

       If a program returns exit code 99, qqmmaaiill--llooccaall ignores  all  succeeding
       lines in ..qqmmaaiill, but it still pays attention to previous forward lines.

       To set up independent instructions,  where  a  temporary  or  permanent
       failure  in  one  instruction  does  not  affect  the others, move each
       instruction into a separate ..qqmmaaiill--_e_x_t  file,  and  set  up  a  central
       ..qqmmaaiill  file that forwards to all of the ..qqmmaaiill--_e_x_ts.  Note that qqmmaaiill--
       llooccaall can handle any number of forward lines simultaneously.
