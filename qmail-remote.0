       qmail-remote - send mail via SMTP

       qqmmaaiill--rreemmoottee _h_o_s_t _s_e_n_d_e_r _r_e_c_i_p [ _r_e_c_i_p _._._.  ]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       qqmmaaiill--rreemmoottee  reads a mail message from its input and sends the message
       to one or more recipients at a remote host.

       The remote host is qqmmaaiill--rreemmoottee's first argument,  _h_o_s_t.   qqmmaaiill--rreemmoottee
       sends  the  message  to _h_o_s_t, or to a mail exchanger for _h_o_s_t listed in
       the Domain Name System, via the Simple Mail Transfer  Protocol  (SMTP).
       _h_o_s_t can be either a fully-qualified domain name:

            silverton.berkeley.edu

       or an IP address enclosed in brackets:

            [128.32.183.163]

       The  envelope  recipient  addresses  are  listed  as _r_e_c_i_p arguments to
       qqmmaaiill--rreemmoottee.  The envelope sender address is listed as _s_e_n_d_e_r.

       Note that qqmmaaiill--rreemmoottee does not take options and does  not  follow  the
       ggeettoopptt standard.

TTRRAANNSSPPAARREENNCCYY
       End-of-file in SMTP is encoded as dot CR LF.  A dot at the beginning of
       a line is encoded as dot dot.  It is  impossible  in  SMTP  to  send  a
       message  that  does  not end with a newline.  qqmmaaiill--rreemmoottee converts the
       UNIX newline convention into the SMTP newline convention  by  inserting
       CR before each LF.

       It  is a violation of the SMTP protocol to send a message that contains
       long lines or non-ASCII characters.  However, qqmmaaiill--rreemmoottee will happily
       send   such  messages.   It  is  the  user's  responsibility  to  avoid
       generating illegal messages.

RREESSUULLTTSS
       qqmmaaiill--rreemmoottee prints some number of _r_e_c_i_p_i_e_n_t  _r_e_p_o_r_t_s,  followed  by  a
       _m_e_s_s_a_g_e  _r_e_p_o_r_t.   Each  report is terminated by a 0 byte.  Each report
       begins with a single letter:

       r    Recipient report: acceptance.

       h    Recipient report: permanent rejection.

       s    Recipient report: temporary rejection.

       K    Message  report:  success.   _h_o_s_t  has  taken  responsibility  for
            delivering the message to each acceptable recipient.

       Z    Message report: temporary failure.

       D    Message report: permanent failure.

       After  this letter comes a human-readable description of what happened.

       The recipient reports will always be  printed  in  the  same  order  as
       qqmmaaiill--rreemmoottee's  _r_e_c_i_p  arguments.  Note that in failure cases there may
       be fewer recipient reports than _r_e_c_i_p arguments.

       qqmmaaiill--rreemmoottee always exits zero.

       _c_l_i_e_n_t_c_e_r_t_._p_e_m
            SSL certificate that is  used  to  authenticate  with  the  remote
            server during a TLS session.

       _h_e_l_o_h_o_s_t
            Current  host  name,  for use solely in saying hello to the remote
            SMTP server.  Default: _m_e, if that is supplied;  otherwise  qqmmaaiill--
            rreemmoottee refuses to run.


       _n_o_t_l_s_h_o_s_t_s_/_<_F_Q_D_N_>
            qqmmaaiill--rreemmoottee  will  not  try  TLS  on  servers for which this file
            exists (<<FFQQDDNN>> is the fully-qualified domain name of the  server).
            _(_t_l_s_h_o_s_t_s_/_<_F_Q_D_N_>_._p_e_m takes precedence over this file however).


       _s_m_t_p_r_o_u_t_e_s
            Artificial  SMTP  routes.   Each  route has the form _d_o_m_a_i_n::_r_e_l_a_y,
            without any extra spaces.  If _d_o_m_a_i_n  matches  _h_o_s_t,  qqmmaaiill--rreemmoottee
            will  connect  to _r_e_l_a_y, as if _h_o_s_t had _r_e_l_a_y as its only MX.  (It
            will also avoid doing any  CNAME  lookups  on  _r_e_c_i_p.)   _h_o_s_t  may
            include  a  colon  and  a port number to use instead of the normal
            SMTP port, 25:

               inside.af.mil:firewall.af.mil:26

            _r_e_l_a_y may be empty; this tells qqmmaaiill--rreemmoottee to look up MX  records
            as  usual.   _p_o_r_t  value of 465 (deprecated smtps port) causes TLS
            session to be started.  _s_m_t_p_r_o_u_t_e_s may include wildcards:

               .af.mil:
               :heaven.af.mil

            Here any address ending with ..aaff..mmiill (but not  aaff..mmiill  itself)  is
            routed by its MX records; any other address is artificially routed
            to hheeaavveenn..aaff..mmiill.

            The qqmmaaiill system does not protect you if you create an  artificial
            mail  loop  between  machines.  However, you are always safe using
            _s_m_t_p_r_o_u_t_e_s if you do not accept mail from the network.

       _t_i_m_e_o_u_t_c_o_n_n_e_c_t
            Number of seconds qqmmaaiill--rreemmoottee  will  wait  for  the  remote  SMTP
            server  to accept a connection.  Default: 60.  The kernel normally
            imposes a 75-second upper limit.

       _t_i_m_e_o_u_t_r_e_m_o_t_e
            Number of seconds qqmmaaiill--rreemmoottee will wait for  each  response  from
            the remote SMTP server.  Default: 1200.


       _t_l_s_c_l_i_e_n_t_c_i_p_h_e_r_s
            A set of OpenSSL client cipher strings. Multiple ciphers contained
            in a string should be separated by a colon.


       _t_l_s_h_o_s_t_s_/_<_F_Q_D_N_>_._p_e_m
            qqmmaaiill--rreemmoottee requires TLS authentication from  servers  for  which
            this file exists (<<FFQQDDNN>> is the fully-qualified domain name of the
            server). One of the _d_N_S_N_a_m_e or the _C_o_m_m_o_n_N_a_m_e attributes  have  to
            match. The file contains the trusted CA certificates.

            WWAARRNNIINNGG::  this  option  may  cause  mail  to  be delayed, bounced,
            doublebounced, or lost.


       _t_l_s_h_o_s_t_s_/_e_x_h_a_u_s_t_i_v_e_l_i_s_t
            if this file exists no TLS will be tried on hosts other than those
            for which a file ttllsshhoossttss//<<FFQQDDNN>>..ppeemm exists.
