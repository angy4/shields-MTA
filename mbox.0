       mbox - file containing mail messages

IINNTTRROODDUUCCTTIIOONN
       The most common format for storage of mail messages is _m_b_o_x format.  An
       _m_b_o_x is a single file containing zero or more mail messages.

       A message encoded in _m_b_o_x format begins with a  FFrroomm__  line,  continues
       with  a series of non-FFrroomm__ lines, and ends with a blank line.  A FFrroomm__
       line means any line that begins with the characters F, r, o, m, space:

            How's that mail system project coming along?


       The final line is a completely blank line (no spaces or tabs).   Notice
       that blank lines may also appear elsewhere in the message.

       The  FFrroomm__  line  always  looks  like  FFrroomm  _e_n_v_s_e_n_d_e_r  _d_a_t_e  _m_o_r_e_i_n_f_o.
       _e_n_v_s_e_n_d_e_r is one word, without  spaces  or  tabs;  it  is  usually  the
       envelope  sender  of  the  message.   _d_a_t_e  is the delivery date of the
       message.  It always contains exactly 24 characters in  aassccttiimmee  format.
       _m_o_r_e_i_n_f_o is optional; it may contain arbitrary information.

       Between  the  FFrroomm__  line  and  the  blank line is a message in RFC 822
       format, as described in qqmmaaiill--hheeaaddeerr((55)), subject to  >>FFrroomm  qquuoottiinngg  as
       described below.

       Here is how a program appends a message to an _m_b_o_x file.

       It  first  creates a FFrroomm__ line given the message's envelope sender and
       the current date.  If the envelope sender is empty (i.e., if this is  a
       bounce  message),  the  program  uses  MMAAIILLEERR--DDAAEEMMOONN  instead.   If the
       envelope  sender  contains  spaces,  tabs,  or  newlines,  the  program
       replaces them with hyphens.

       The  program  then  copies  the message, applying >>FFrroomm qquuoottiinngg to each
       line.  >>FFrroomm qquuoottiinngg ensures that the resulting  lines  are  not  FFrroomm__
       lines: the program prepends a >> to any FFrroomm__ line, >>FFrroomm__ line, >>>>FFrroomm__
       line, >>>>>>FFrroomm__ line, etc.

       Finally the program appends a blank line to the message.  If  the  last
       line  of  the  message  was  a  partial  line,  it writes two newlines;
       otherwise it writes one.

       A reader scans through an _m_b_o_x file looking for FFrroomm__ lines.  Any FFrroomm__
       line  marks  the beginning of a message.  The reader should not attempt
       to take advantage of the fact that every FFrroomm__ line (past the beginning
       of the file) is preceded by a blank line.

       Once  the  reader  finds  a message, it extracts a (possibly corrupted)
       envelope sender and delivery date out of the FFrroomm__ line.  It then reads
       until  the  next  FFrroomm__ line or end of file, whichever comes first.  It
       strips off the final blank line and deletes the quoting of >>FFrroomm__ lines
       and >>>>FFrroomm__ lines and so on.  The result is an RFC 822 message.

       There are many variants of _m_b_o_x format.  The variant described above is
       _m_b_o_x_r_d format, popularized by Rahul Dhesi in June 1995.

       The original _m_b_o_x_o format quotes only FFrroomm__ lines,  not  >>FFrroomm__  lines.
       As a result it is impossible to tell whether

       was quoted in the original message.  An _m_b_o_x_r_d reader will always strip
       off the quoting.

       _m_b_o_x_c_l format is like _m_b_o_x_o format, but includes a Content-Length field
       with the number of bytes in the message.  _m_b_o_x_c_l_2 format is like _m_b_o_x_c_l
       but has no >>FFrroomm quoting.  These formats  are  used  by  SVR4  mailers.
       _m_b_o_x_c_l_2 cannot be read safely by _m_b_o_x_r_d readers.

       There  are  many locking mechanisms for _m_b_o_x files.  qqmmaaiill--llooccaall always
       uses fflloocckk on systems that have it, otherwise lloocckkff.

       The delivery date in a FFrroomm__ line does not specify a time zone.  qqmmaaiill--
       llooccaall always creates the delivery date in GMT so that _m_b_o_x files can be
       safely transported from one time zone to another.

       If the mtime on a nonempty _m_b_o_x file is greater  than  the  atime,  the
       file  has  new  mail.   If the mtime is smaller than the atime, the new
       mail has been read.  If the atime equals the mtime, there is no way  to
       tell  whether  the file has new mail, since qqmmaaiill--llooccaall takes much less
       than  a  second  to  run.   One  solution  is  for  a  mail  reader  to
       artificially  set the atime to the mtime plus 1.  Then the file has new
       mail if and only if the atime is less than or equal to the mtime.

       Some mail readers place SSttaattuuss fields in each message to indicate which
       messages have been read.
